# Customer_Segmentation_Project
### An automobile company has plans to enter new markets with their existing products. After intensive market research, theyâ€™ve deduced that the behavior of the new market is similar to their existing market.
### In their existing market, the sales team has classified all customers into 2 segments High Quality Customers and Low Quality Customers. Then, they performed segmented outreach and communication for a different segment of customers. 
### This strategy has work exceptionally well for them. They plan to use the same strategy for the new markets and have identified 2627 new potential customers.
### The task is to predict the right group of the new customers. 

## Objective: Customer Group Prediction Workflow
### To accomplish the task of predicting the appropriate customer groups, the following sequential steps have been designed:

## Step 1: Data Cleansing
### Commencing with data import, the initial focus lies on addressing missing values within the datasets.
## Step 2: Training a Classification Model
### This stage involves training and evaluating four distinct classification algorithms: Random Forest Classifier, XGBoost Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbours Classifier, and Logistic Regression Classifier.
## Step 3: Application of Optimal Classification Model
### The best-performing classification model is employed to predict segmentation for new potential customers. This forecasting process aids in identifying the appropriate customer group for each individual.
